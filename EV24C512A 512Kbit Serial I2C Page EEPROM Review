Pin Configuration and Functional Description
The EV24C512A EEPROM features several key pins:

A0-A2: Address inputs, allowing up to 8 devices on a single I2C bus
SDA: Serial Data (bi-directional)
SCL: Serial Clock Input
WP: Write Protect
GND: Ground
Vcc: Power Supply
Device Operation
Start/Stop Conditions: Initiated by high-to-low and low-to-high transitions of SDA with SCL high, respectively.
Acknowledgment: The EEPROM sends a "0" to acknowledge receipt of each byte.
Standby Mode: Enabled upon power-up and after receipt of the STOP bit.
Memory Organization
The memory is organized with 512 pages of 128 bytes each.
Requires a 16-bit data word address for random word addressing.
Write Operations
Byte Write: Two 8-bit data word addresses followed by the data word, ending with a STOP condition to initiate the write cycle.
Page Write: Allows up to 128 bytes to be written in one operation, with the address incrementing internally.
Read Operations
Current Address Read: Reads the byte at the current address.
Random Read: Requires a dummy byte write sequence to set the address before reading.
Sequential Read: Reads consecutive bytes, automatically incrementing the address.
Identification Page
An additional 128-byte page can be written and locked in read-only mode for storing sensitive data.
